# Documentation Tab Server Logic
# Author: Eren Ada, PhD

# Server logic for the Documentation tab

# Note: This tab is primarily static content with external links,
# so minimal server logic is required. The tab serves as a navigation
# hub to the documentation files hosted on GitHub.

# All documentation links point to the GitHub repository for:
# 1. Always up-to-date content
# 2. Proper markdown rendering
# 3. Easy maintenance and updates
# 4. Accessibility from anywhere

# Future enhancements could include:
# - Local documentation viewer
# - Search functionality within docs
# - Interactive tutorials
# - Context-sensitive help based on current tab
